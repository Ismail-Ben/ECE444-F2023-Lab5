# What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Here is a short list of the pros and cons of TDD

Pros:

Continuous Integration: TDD is well-suited for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Automated tests ensure that changes can be deployed confidently.

Reduced Debugging Time: TDD often leads to fewer bugs in the first place, reducing the time and effort spent on debugging and troubleshooting.

Cons:

Incomplete Coverage: TDD doesn't guarantee that all aspects of a system are tested thoroughly. Developers might focus on writing tests for the parts they are most familiar with.

Time-Consuming: Initially, writing tests before code can be time-consuming. TDD can slow down development, especially when tight deadlines exist.
